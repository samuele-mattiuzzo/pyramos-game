This is PYRAMOS, a dungeon crawling puzzle game

The game is developed using PYGAME (http://www.pygame.org/news.html)

HOW TO PLAY:

- use the arrows to move the adventurer
- everytime the adventurer moves, he'll see the valid steps around himself. Walls will not be uncovered. Corners can't be seen around. 
- reach the end of the dungeon
- avoid hitting the walls (aka don't try to move toward one of them) or you'll die of a trap

DUNGEON TILES:

- # -> this represents a wall or a covered tile
- an empty tile represents a valid path
- @ -> this is you!
- S -> start
- E -> end
